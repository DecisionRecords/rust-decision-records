# The TODO list

Thanks for showing an interest in this project. Here's what I've got outstanding, and what I've done already!

## TODO Items

Oh my word, there are SO MANY things here.

* [ ] Documentation is sorely needed, both in the code itself, and updating the README
* [ ] Create new DR entries (see [decision_records.rs](src/decision_record.rs))
* [ ] Link ("amends", "deprecates", "links") two DRs together
* [ ] Change status ("proposed", "accepted") of a DR (code exists to get to that function, but the function isn't written)
* [ ] Consider allowing non-numbered DR creation action (e.g. `doc/decision_record/some-decision-record.md` instead of `doc/decision_record/0001-some-decision-record.md`)
* [ ] Create more language strings!
* [ ] Create testing!
  * [ ] Unit Testing needed
  * [ ] DocTests required
  * [ ] Consistent Functional Testing (across all DecisionRecords repos) with BATS is also desired!

## DONE Items

* [x] Create code to init the directories needed (doc/adr or doc/decision_records)
* [x] Allow i18n of template loading

Want to get involved? Please [look at the code](https://github.com/DecisionRecords/rust-decision-records), and make Pull Requests if you can fix or improve things.
